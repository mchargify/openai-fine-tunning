- Your file contains 500 prompt-completion pairs
- There are 124 duplicated prompt-completion sets. These are rows: [5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 36, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 84, 101, 102, 104, 108, 109, 112, 114, 115, 120, 122, 123, 131, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 150, 153, 166, 170, 196, 206, 207, 210, 230, 241, 272, 278, 296, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 328, 336, 337, 339, 349, 373, 375, 376, 377, 383, 387, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 438, 439, 440, 441, 452, 460, 462, 463, 464, 475, 476, 485, 487, 499]
- All prompts end with suffix `er. How how tall is he?`. This suffix seems very long. Consider replacing with a shorter suffix, such as ` ->`
- All prompts start with prefix `A player `
- All completions start with prefix `A player `. Most of the time you should only add the output data into the completion, without any prefix
- All completions end with suffix ` cm tall.`
- The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `). This tends to produce better results due to the tokenization we use. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more details

Based on the analysis we will perform the following actions:
- [Recommended] Remove 124 duplicate rows [Y/n]: Y
- [Recommended] Remove prefix `A player ` from all completions [Y/n]: Y
